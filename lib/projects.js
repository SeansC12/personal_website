      "A powerful and accurate pill counter using computer vision.",
    longDescription1: `PillVision consists of 2 servers, a Flask server and a React server. 
\nThe React server, running on the client, sends a <i>POST</i> request to the Flask server, with the image of the pills from the camera feed attached as the payload every 1.5 seconds. 
\nThe Flask server will then use the custom-trained YOLOv8 model to perform inferencing on the image. The YOLOv8 model will return the total number of pills and its corresponding coordinates. The Flask server then performs our damaged pill detection algorithm, subsequently returning the total number of damaged pills and its corresponding coordinates. The Flask server then sends the total number of pills and damaged pills back to the React server, which will then display the results on the screen.`,
    longDescription2: `Both the Flask server and React server are containerised with Docker. For deployment, the Flask server is deployed as a container and the React server is deployed with Vercel. During development, both applications were containerised as we were developing on different operating systems; our laptop (M1 MacBook) and the NVIDIA Jetson. Both images are pushed to Dockerhub.`,
    longDescription3: `The machine had to run offline, so we used the powerful NVIDIA Jetson Nano 4GB to run both servers. I learnt a lot about Linux and CUDA during this project. Many problems surfaced while running the application on the Jetson (due to faulty hardware). There was one point where the Jetson could not boot up, and missing dependencies everywhere, Docker container not being able to access the CUDA cores etc. Trying to debug the OS issues and CUDA issues led me to learn a lot about Linux; system privileges, package installations, bash, and more. In the end, I am proud to say that it worked.`,
    longDescription4: `The team trained a custom YOLOv8 model to detect pills. The model was trained on a dataset of 1368 images, and achieved a precision of 94.3%. It was trained on Google Colab's GPUs, and it took a little over 12 hours to train.`,

\nKey features include Diary, where users can record their feelings, which are then analyzed using AI sentiment analysis to understand their emotions. The app plots mood scores on a graph, using linear regression to detect trends. The Inquire feature offers a reflective questionnaire as a simple alternative.
\nThe Learn More page debunks myths and provides information on common mental illnesses, combating stereotypes and misconceptions.
\nMentalStop won the Distinction Award at the IMDA DigitalForLife Youth Awards in 2022, recognizing its positive impact on the community.
